**[🚀 Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/183fep_N2ucR3ul8r6cQ2CxN4dtcSLtwP?usp=sharing)** - Try the project yourself!

1. **Start with quality corpus:** Diverse, clean, representative data
2. **Choose N wisely:** Balance between coherence and creativity (3-4 often works well)
3. **Iterate frequently:** Many small updates beat few large ones
4. **Monitor diversity:** Ensure model doesn't converge to repetitive outputs
5. **Save checkpoints:** Keep versions to compare progress

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Notebook
1. Open the Colab notebook
2. Upload your CSV dataset (with a text column)
3. Run cells sequentially:
   - Build corpus
   - Train n-gram model
   - Generate samples
   - Provide feedback
   - Observe improvements

### Customization
- **Change N:** Modify context size for different pattern complexity
- **Adjust learning rate:** Control how quickly model adapts to feedback
- **Vary corpus:** Try different text styles/domains
- **Experiment with rewards:** Test different feedback strategies

## 🎓 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pandas (for CSV handling)
- collections (defaultdict, Counter)
- random (for sampling)

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Colab notebook
3. Follow the step-by-step cells
4. Experiment with your own data!

## 📖 Learning Resources

### Key Takeaways
- **N-grams capture local patterns** in text
- **Probabilistic generation** creates varied outputs
- **Reinforcement learning** aligns models with human values
- **EOS tokens** provide natural boundaries
- **Iteration** is key to improvement

### Connections to Broader Concepts
- **Markov Chains:** N-grams are Markov models (next state depends only on last N states)
- **Language Modeling:** Foundation for modern NLP (GPT, BERT build on these ideas)
- **RLHF:** This project demonstrates reinforcement learning from human feedback at a basic level
- **Generative Models:** Understanding generation from probability distributions

**Happy Learning! 🎉**

Remember: The best way to understand these concepts is to run the code, experiment with parameters, and observe how changes affect output. Each iteration teaches you something new about how language models work.
